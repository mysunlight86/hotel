### Technologies
1. [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)
    * webpack &mdash; collector of modules and resources

    * webpack-dev-server &mdash; a development server
    * html-webpack-plugin &mdash; creates an HTML file based on a template
    * clean-webpack-plugin &mdash; cleans up the dist directory every time the project is built. This allows you to automatically delete old files that are no longer needed.
    * file-loader &mdash; to emit a file into the output directory
    * css-loader &mdash; loading styles for the main JS file containing the CSS import
    * style-loader &mdash; applying styles to DOM elements via the style element
    * copy-webpack-plugin &mdash; —Åopies individual files or entire directories, which already exist, to the build directory.
    * mini-css-extract-plugin &mdash; extracts CSS into separate files. It creates a CSS file per JS file which contains CSS.
    * css-minimizer-webpack-plugin &mdash; uses cssnano to optimize and minify CSS files
2. [babel](https://babeljs.io/)
    * babel-loader &mdash; transpiling files with Babel and webpack
    * @babel/core &mdash; transpiling ES2015 + to backward compatible JavaScript
    * @babel/preset-env &mdash; useful Babel default settings
    * @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties &mdash; example of custom Babel configuration (setting instance properties in the body of the class, not in its constructor)
3. [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

4. [jquery](https://jquery.com/)
